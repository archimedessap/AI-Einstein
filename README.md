Auto-encoding in Relativity

The main purpose of this project is to use real data from scientific discoveries in the history of science for research on scientific rediscovery through machine learning. Unlike previous studies on scientific rediscovery using machine learning, 

I used real observational and experimental data on the ether problem, such as historical observational data of stellar aberration and real data from the Michelson-Morley experiment, and performed interpolation processing.

Since the model is relatively simple, I put the data preparation and production process all in the main program. The historical data of stellar aberration and the Michelson-Morley experiment can be seen in the figures in the article. I will organize the historical data and put it in the data folder later.
