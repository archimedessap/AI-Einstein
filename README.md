Auto-encoding in Relativity
The main purpose of this project is to conduct scientific rediscovery using real historical data of scientific discoveries, employing machine learning techniques. Unlike previous studies on scientific rediscovery using machine learning, I have utilized actual observational and experimental data concerning the ether problem, such as historical observations of the aberration of light and real data from the Michelson-Morley experiment, while also applying interpolation techniques.
I employed a simple autoencoder to explore the possibility of simultaneously satisfying multiple observations and experimental data regarding light propagation in the 19th century. The final results indicate that the model not only discovered the Lorentz transformation but also suggested that the hypothesis of the absence of the ether is optimal.
Since the model is relatively simple, I will include the data preparation and production process in the main program. The historical data for the aberration of light and the Michelson-Morley experiment can be found in the illustrations in the article. I will organize the historical data and place it in the "data" folder later.
